# project-lion
The next generation of KSAClan.xyz, Project Lion aims to return KSAClan.xyz to it's former state while improving security and adding new features.

This repo will not be updated or maintained until 1.0 is released. This is to make sure that code that is completely unstable and had gaping security holes isn't used by anybody. Thanks for the understanding.
